is a classroom interaction system that allows students to use their own
devices (mobile phones, tablets or laptops) to respond to questions
dusting class. The motivation behind developing it was that the clicker
systems we use at the University of Glasgow were becomming increasingly
problematic - making sure batteries were OK, identifying broken
hand-sets and getting them to the right lecture theatre all posed
problems. Since almost all stuudents carry a smartphone or other device
it seemed logical to replace the clicker system with a web based system.<br><h3>A few features</h3><ul><li>Multiple choice and text input questions</li><li>SMS support (for the few students who don't have smartphones.)</li><li>Optional microblogging&nbsp;</li><li>Optional <a href="http://learn.gla.ac.uk/yacrs/software/">teacher control application</a> provides a simple way of using MCQs along with Powerpoint.</li><li>Open source (Apache 2 licence)</li><li>Either logged in (using LDAP) or guest modes.</li></ul></body></html>
