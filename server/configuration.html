<h1>YACRS Configuration</h1>
<p>YACRS (Yet Another Class Response System) is a simple application
for recieving feedback from students during classroom teaching.
The students use a browser on their own computers or mobile phones, and
the teacher can either use a browser or a simple floating
application to run the session.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul><li>Web server with PHP 5 or later.</li>
<li>MySQL database</li>
<li>Access to an LDAP system for authentication</li>


</ul><h2>Installation</h2>First create an empty MySQL database to be
used by YACRS - at the command line log in to MySQL as the root user:
&nbsp;In this example the database, user and password are all 'yacrs',
however these can be anything you wish. This example also assumes that
the database server is on the same machine as the web server.<br><br>&gt; sudo mysql -u root -p.<br><br>Type the password<br><br>mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE yacrs;<br>mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON yacrs.* TO 'yacrs'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yacrs';<br>mysql&gt; exit;<br><br>Next
copy the YACRS disribution files into a folder in the web server
folder, e.g. on Ubuntu 18.04 this might be /var/www/html/yacrs<br><br>You will need to either edit the config.php file, or create a configuration file called yacrs_config.php in the folder above it.<br><br>The
best approach is to follow the instructions in the config_example.php
file, modifying it to suit your needs. You will need to know the
settings for your institutions LDAP server.<br><br>Once the
configuration has been completed and saved, you can run initialise.php
to initialise the database.
